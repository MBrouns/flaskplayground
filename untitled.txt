# Web API that allows for the following:

- I want to be able push new names to the API
  POST /names/matthijs -> 201

- I also want to get existing names
  GET /names/matthijs -> 200: hello matthijs
  
- I also want that getting a not previously added name returns a 404
  GET /names/youness -> 404
  
- I also want to get all the names
  GET /names -> [Matthijs]
  
  
For now, it's fine if the server loses all data when it restarts
